Brisbane had the best chances with their set pieces, with Wenzel-Hall creating a number of corners for Brisbane. While Brisbane were able to produce brilliant delivery, they were unable to get the final touch</span></span></li><li id="https://www.notion.so/f23a304f48474dbf88b11f556e59dc76" class="BulletedList"><span class="SemanticStringArray"><span class="SemanticString">Maclaren had a quiet opening 20 minutes but had two headers and almost set up a goal for Adrian Luna in the 30th minute. Shortly after City dealt with another Brisbane free kick from just outside the box, the captain Scott Jamieson set up Melbourne City&#x27;s best chance of the game but Maclaren&#x27;s header was unable to trouble the keeper</span></span></li><li id="https://www.notion.so/2b32fa6bcf114a9490b93deba3a7b8ed" class="BulletedList"><span class="SemanticStringArray"><span class="SemanticString">City were let off a number of times with poor passes, with an apparent inability to pass accurately with enough speed, but each time they gave the ball away they were able to press and either win the ball back or prevent the Brisbane players from getting a good sight on goal</span></span></li><li id="https://www.notion.so/18dbdf72c4a44abcab9c5168d2a79270" class="BulletedList"><span class="SemanticStringArray"><span class="SemanticString">City started to gain some ascendancy in the last 10 minutes of the first half, with Andrew Nabbout playing well and cutting in frequently from the wing. He set up a shot which was saved easily before being cheaply fouled and giving City a corner, however Jamie Maclaren was again unable to get a shot on target</span></span></li><li id="https://www.notion.so/d4f8ee631e584009890170b203f939e2" class="BulletedList"><span class="SemanticStringArray"><span class="SemanticString">The fouls kept coming throughout the entire half, however no cards were drawn by the referee and neither team was able to trouble the keeper from these free kicks</span></span></li><li id="https://www.notion.so/bbe4ecd1b64d485691309d2e679d107d" class="BulletedList"><span class="SemanticStringArray"><span class="SemanticString">Luna and Nabbout got into a fight with Gillespe from the Brisbane Roar over an incident involving Luna picking up the ball after it going out of play but the referee didn&#x27;t look closely at it</span></span></li><li id="https://www.notion.so/1319dbd1794d48c99f356cec3a88ebf2" class="BulletedList"><span class="SemanticStringArray"><span class="SemanticString">As per OneFootball, City had 65% possession in the first half and while both teams had 8 shots, City preferred to take their shots from outside the box. In terms of defensive tactics, the tackle numbers and blocks were very similar for both teams</span></span></li><li id="https://www.notion.so/a33bd3699739415a95ffe9cc593b38e6" class="BulletedList"><span class="SemanticStringArray"><span class="SemanticString">City made the most of their momentum by pulling in front from a beautiful goal from Connor Metcalfe, assisted by Maclaren and lifting it over the Brisbane keeper to make it 1-0 to the Cityzens.</span></span></li><li id="https://www.notion.so/f3cce12b697845069c75ce6e446f32ac" class="BulletedList"><span class="SemanticStringArray"><span class="SemanticString">Andrew Nabbout looked to have a hamstring injury just before the hour mark and play stopped so that the medics could have a look at him. He walked off the pitch, which obviously looks more promising than being stretchered off, however it took him over a minute to walk the 20 meters to the interchange bench. Hopefully he&#x27;s okay and we&#x27;ll hear more from the club soon. He was immediately substituted off and play resumed.</span></span></li><li id="https://www.notion.so/f9aad4a45f5c4a709e33c267de7fdc76" class="BulletedList"><span class="SemanticStringArray"><span class="SemanticString">Shortly after Nabbout went off Brisbane had their closest chance all game, with Joey Champness stretching his shot narrowly wide of the far post. City played the goal kick out from the back and immediately went on the attack down the right hand side but the ball spilt out and went for a throw-in to Brisbane</span></span></li><li id="https://www.notion.so/13665fd6379345cca476676b667d6fbc" class="BulletedList"><span class="SemanticStringArray"><span class="SemanticString">Adrian Luna was sent off with a second yellow card in the 70th minute, with the card being quite unfair and leaving City with 10 men for the final 20 minutes. Brisbane had a penalty appeal denied straight after this and City went on the counter attack, which should definitely have resulted in a penalty after a dangerous push in the back.</span></span></li><li id="https://www.notion.so/09c2631a0adf407d834eb2c2c2020e76" class="BulletedList"><span class="SemanticStringArray"><span class="SemanticString">On closer inspection Adrian Luna never made contact and it&#x27;s clear that the decision should have been revoked. It&#x27;s left City quite short on the right-hand side which has previously been their most rewarding part of the pitch</span></span></li><li id="https://www.notion.so/11e0675d34ea434ba2b946b80eb51a09" class="BulletedList"><span class="SemanticStringArray"><span class="SemanticString">Another possible injury to City was a leg cramp to Rostyn Griffiths after being bowled over in his own penalty box. </span></span></li></ul></article>
